										<h1>About me</h1>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/abouthead.jpg" alt=""/></span>
									<p>My name is James Palmer. As a student I studied mathematical computer science and psychology at The University of Illinois in Chicago. Throughout my educational career there have been many different elements of engineering and design. In psychology, designing an apporpriate study to provide insights was an imporant aspect of the course material.</p>
									<p>I was raised outside of Chicago where, in highschool the focus of my studies was purely design and engineering. There, I developed a love for microcontrollers and single board computers. One aspect of my highschool expereince that has been benefitial was how courses were connected through projects. One example is a saponification project that acted as a companion project between a digital electronic course and chemistry. Having these connections built in to these courses have lead me to draw connections between future courses in ways that have sometimes been helpful and othertimes have been interesting. </p>
									<p>One instance that this practice has lead me to an interesting place for example is while attending university, I was taking a music theory course, linear algebra and data structures. One day in one of the courses I started to draw connections between all of the courses and began diving into a then new topic to me, artifical neural networks. Learning about how linear algerbra can be used to extend dimensions to infinity, then in music theory about the infinite ability of the combinations that can be made, and finally in data structures I began to see a way to implement the connection I started to see. The final piece of the puzzle for me was a MIT free course that is recomeneded by Tensor Flow which is a neural network library for python.</p>
									<p>The resulting experimentation with these processes is highlighted in the rest of this site so please enjoy exploring the results of my explorations! </p>
